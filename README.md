# Raspberry Pi CAN Connection

## Description

Team Phantom is a club at SFU that is working on an electric vehicle. I set up a Raspberry Pi and mounted a CAN (Controller Area Network) BUS FD Shield onto it so will be used to communicate with the dashboard. After using the python-can library to allow the Raspberry Pi to send and receive data, I used the CANoe software to test and debug the programs.
